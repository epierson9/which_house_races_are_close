# which_house_races_are_close

I was trying to decide which House races were actually close enough that my time or money could make a difference. So I parsed [FiveThirtyEight's assessments](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-big-picture-in-the-race-for-the-house/), parsed [Cook's assessments](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings), and wrote some code to join the two datasets together. (To my knowledge, this combined data doesn't exist in easily sortable/parseable form). This is current as of 8/17/18.
